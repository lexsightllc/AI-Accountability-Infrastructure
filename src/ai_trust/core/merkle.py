Merkle Tree implementation for the transparency log.

This module provides a binary Merkle tree implementation that follows RFC 6962 (Certificate Transparency)
for hashing and proof generation. It includes support for:
- Efficient inclusion proofs
- Consistency proofs between tree states
- Batch updates
- Caching of intermediate nodes for performance

Domain separation is used to prevent second preimage attacks.
