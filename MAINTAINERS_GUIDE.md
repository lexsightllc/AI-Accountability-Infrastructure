# Maintainer's Guide

This guide is for maintainers of the AI Trust project.

## Reviewing Pull Requests

When reviewing pull requests:

1. **Check the code**:
   - Does it work as intended?
   - Is the code clean and well-documented?
   - Are there any security concerns?

2. **Check the tests**:
   - Are there tests for new features?
   - Do all tests pass?
   - Is the test coverage adequate?

3. **Check the documentation**:
   - Is the documentation up to date?
   - Are there any new features that need documentation?

4. **Check the changelog**:
   - Is the changelog updated?
   - Are the changes properly documented?

## Making a Release

1. Update the version in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml)
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the new version
3. Create a new tag:
   ```bash
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Version X.Y.Z"
   ```
4. Push the tag:
   ```bash
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```
5. Create a new release on GitHub
